Whenever I am looking for a file my first reflex was to use the [`find`](https://www.mankier.com/1/find) command. After all, it was made to do just that: search for files in a directory hierarchy.

```bash
find . -name "*rib*pdf"
```

Confession time! I cannot remember how `find` work without checking the `man` or `tldr`. To me, `find` is a `tar`...

To my `find` issue, I found a solution: `locate`.

```bash
locate "*rib*pdf"
```

My current distribution already had it. If yours do not, you can search for the package `mlocate`.

I am aware of [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), but I did not try it yet. It mays be even better.
