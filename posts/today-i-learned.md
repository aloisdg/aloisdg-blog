In France, we are taught british-oxfordish-fish & chipish english. So I know _by heart_ that the correct past tense of the verb learn is learnt. Now, like a group of poet said _We're all living in Amerika_ and I am definitely more use to the murica's form. Thanks [/r/til](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/) I guess.

I will start using "learned" over "learnt" on a daily basis. "-ed" is already mostly the past tense mark in british english. Let's consider the american version as a feature istead of bug.
