To run your extension with a version of Firefox Desktop other than the default, like the Firefox Developer Edition, use the `--firefox` option to specify a full path to the binary file.

First let's find the path to our binary. Since we are using GNU/Linux, it is really easy:

    which firefox-developer-edition

And the path found is `/usr/bin/firefox-developer-edition`.

Now we can run

    web-ext run --firefox="/usr/bin/firefox-developer-edition"

And voil√†.
