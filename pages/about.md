As a software developer, Alo√Øs applies the principles of software craftmanship to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software. To build working and useful solutions, he likes to be able to work in all the layers of the stack from data to UI. To create, improve and share his creations, he had to dabble in design, communication, sales and translations.

During his journey, he started a company, wrote weekly for a news website with around 100k views monthly, built a dozen of applications with one going above 300k download worldwide, contributed to hundreds of projects including tools, library and more, worked in fintech, and now in hospitality at D-EDGE.
